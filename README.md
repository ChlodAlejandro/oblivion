An inescapable webpage which repeats a YouTube video forever, preventing any mouse clicks or keyboard presses. Good way to annoy your friends.

A working copy of this can be found at https://oblivion.chlod.net.

This project is named after [o b l i v i o n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVwJqEXWSOQ).
